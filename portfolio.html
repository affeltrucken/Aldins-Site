        <div class="smallest paragraph justify-text" style="display=none">Roughly one year ago, I got an early 18th birthday present from my mom. It was a Pixel 7 Pro, a phone I had been interested in for a while. The main reason I chose this phone was because it was said to have a great camera. I had always been interested in arts of all kinds, like music, film, and painting, and this new phone gave me a new opportunity to pursue yet another art, photography.

        Fast forward a couple of months later, I had started taking photos everyday of ordinary things, places, and people, just for the fun of it, but I felt limited in the medium I was shooting with. I didn't have the fine controls and freedom that I wanted through a phone. I was interested in getting a dedicated camera, and that's when a relative reached out and told me they had a camera lying around that they weren't using that I got to borrow. It was a Nikon D5100. An old, beginner camera, with a kit-lens, but I was hooked.
